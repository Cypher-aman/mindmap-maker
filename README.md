**Features:**

-   **Create and Edit Nodes:**  Add, edit, and connect nodes to represent concepts and relationships.
-   **Save and Download:**  Preserve your mind maps by saving them to a file format (further details needed) and download them as images for easy sharing.
-   **Color Customization:**  Tailor the appearance of nodes with a color selection feature.
-   **Node Management:**
    -   **Change Title/Details:**  Update the primary content (title) and additional details associated with each node.
    -   **Duplicate Nodes:**  Quickly create copies of existing nodes for efficient mind mapping.
    -   **Delete Nodes:**  Remove nodes when necessary to refine your mind map structure.
-   **Node Interaction:**
    -   **Hover Details:**  Gain quick insights into node content by hovering over them.
    -   **Deep View:**  Dive deeper into a node by clicking on it. This opens a popup (consider including details about the popup's content and interactivity).

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

**Setup:**

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Cypher-aman/mindmap-maker.git
    
    ```
    
   
    

    
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd <your-repo-name>
    
    ```
    


    
3.  Install dependencies:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm install
    ``` (or `yarn install`)
    
    
    ```
    

    

    
4.  Run the development server:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    ``` (or `yarn dev`)
    
    
    ```
    


    

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:5173/).

**Usage:**

The user interface should be intuitive, allowing you to interact with the mind map through the toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, and node selection.

**Tech Stack:**

-   React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   React Flow: Library for creating interactive node-based diagrams
-   Vite: Build tool for modern web development
